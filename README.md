# Face-Morphing

This is our term project for the course EE417 (Computer Vision). I've completed this project with my classmate [Emre Duman](https://github.com/Lieutenant-Mom). 

This is a face morphing project that has two aims: 
1) Introducing an AI assisted face morphing technique â€“ the use of machine learning techniques to automatically generate a smooth transition between two or more faces. 
2) Exploring a novel use case, namely dataset optimization technique for an eigenfaces dataset.

You can see the source code in the .ipynb file and our final report in the Report.pdf file. We've worked in the Google Colab environment throughout the development but if you want to give it a try you can use the other .py file and images to import them locally.
