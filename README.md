# Face-Morphing

This is our term project for the course EE417 (Computer Vision). We've worked together with my classmate [Emre Duman](https://github.com/Lieutenant-Mom) to complete this project. 

### Motivation
This is a face morphing project that has two aims: 
1) Introducing an AI assisted face morphing technique â€“ the use of machine learning techniques to automatically generate a smooth transition between two or more faces. 
2) Exploring a novel use case, namely dataset optimization technique for an eigenfaces dataset.

### Setup
You can see the source code in the .ipynb file and our final report in the Report.pdf file. We've worked in the Google Colab environment throughout the development. If you would like to give it a try in your local system, you can modify the import parts such that importing the helpers.py file (for necessary helper functions) and all the images that are worked on. Then, you can run the .ipynb file without a problem.
